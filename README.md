# Salon Management

Salon Desk is a database-driven system designed to manage salon operations like appointments, services, employees, clients, and inventory. It handles tasks such as booking, staff management, stock tracking, and revenue monitoring across multiple branches.

The database is fully normalized up to BCNF with 14 connected tables ensuring data integrity and minimal redundancy. Features include appointment scheduling, peak-hour analysis, stock-in/stock-out management, and branch-wise revenue reports. This project simulates a real-world salon backend with efficient querying and reliable data management.
